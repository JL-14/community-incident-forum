                    Ever wondered what is happening in a particular place or at
                    a particular time? Why the road is closed, whether there is
                    anything to be aware of on a certain route (potholes,
                    overhanging branches, uneven pavements)?
                    <br>
                    Or maybe you have had a positive or negative experience
                    in a particular location you wish to let others know about?
                    <br>
                    That is where we come in.

                    The Reigate Community Issues and Incidents Forum is your
                    one-stop shop for information about your local area. It is
                    intended for use by residents (and visitors/commuters, etc)
                    to bring together information from a range of official
                    sources about issues and incidents that may affect your day.
                    The aim is to empower residents to make informed decisions
                    about day-to-day activities, identifying potential obstacles
                    for your plans (whether they be train strikes, road 
                    closures, or other issues).
                    <br>
                    The site combines official notices from local authorities,
                    transport services, and law enforcement with locally
                    generated insights and observations.
