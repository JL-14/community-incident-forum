                        Have you ever wondered what is happening in a particular place or at a particular time? Why the road is closed,
                        whether there is anything to be aware of on a certain route (potholes, overhanging branches, uneven pavements)? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Or maybe you have had a positive or negative experience in a particular location you wish to let others know about?

                        choices, issues to be aware of, and importantly of hazards in the local environment.

                        This forum is maintained by Reigate residents for Reigate residents and visitors. The forum is mediated, and in order to
                        post a report of an incident or issue you need to register and be logged in.

                        Every report is reviewed and, where possible, verified.
                        This is to avoid incorrect or ill-intended content from being posted, but may lead to a slight delay between a report being posted
                        and appearing on the forum.
